1. The ret instruction is executed, which causes the return address (the address of INITRET) to be popped off the stack and loaded into the program counter.
2. INITRET, which acts as a dummy function, starts running
3. The INITRET function calls kill() on the process that is running, in this case it would be the process that returned normally
The next two steps happen inside of the kill() function 
4. The current process is removed from the process table, file discriptors are closed, and its memory is freed
5. XINU scheduler is called so it can select a ready process to run next
